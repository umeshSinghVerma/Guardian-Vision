## Overview ü§ñ

The project aims to develop a system for violence detection using CCTV footage and providing an immediate alert to the police. The system will use advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze the CCTV footage in real-time and detect any violent behavior or actions. Once detected, an automatic alert will be sent to the police, enabling them to respond quickly and take appropriate action. The system has the potential to enhance public safety and reduce crime rates in¬†public¬†areas.

## Usage

To use this project, you need to have a webcam connected to your computer. The project will capture the video stream from the webcam and analyze it for any violent activities. If any violence is detected, the project will send an alert to the respective authorities with the location and timestamp of the incident.

## Features ü¶æ

- Weapon Detection
- Light/dark mode toggle
- Enhance the user experience creating highly reactive website.

<p>The logged in user ca use our services of using his Webcam for Real-time AI detection of physical violence or can upload a video where the AI detects if there is any physical violence present in it.</p>

<li>  Webcam Page</li>  
<p>The User can give the email of his friends and family. Once the webcam start if any voilence detected ,it sends alert to all respective authorities along with the given emails by the User.</p>

<li>  Video upload Page</li>  
<p>The User can upload any video in our website after which the AI detects if there is any violence in it. If there is any suspicious activity present in it, the AI sends a image of that particular frame.</p>
